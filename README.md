# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign
## Overview of Project

- The purpose of this analysis was to analyse how other plays fared out in their fundraising campaigns. We wanted to summarise their performances by creating easy-to-read data to quickly understand their performances. We analysed their launch dates, fundraising goals, and how much was pledged amongst other data and then created charts, graphs, and pivot tables to quickly understand the data, rather than having to comb through rows and columns of numbers. On top of that, we used a variety of formulas to further help us in our analysis. 

## Analysis and Challenges

- I began my analysis by using the Kickstarter Data we had been using throughout the module. One challenge I quickly faced was that I thought we had to start from scratch and re-download the data. After talking to a classmate, I was able to understand that we were supposed to keep using the data we had been working on during the module. That made things a lot quicker to understand and I was able to get back on track. My teammate, while helping me out, realised some information on my excel was off so we spent some time cleaning up my data sheet. After a bit of time, I was able to work on my own. 

- Following the instructions, I was able to work efficiently through the assignment. There were however some areas that I lacked understanding, which led me to other sources of information in order to understand exactly what I need to do, but more importantly what I was doing wrong. 

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Starting with Deliverable 1, I worked on cleaning up my excel sheet before being able to dive into creating a pivot table and the required graph. After some time, I was able to begin the table and placed the information in the right columns and rows. Although I didn't do it right at first, messing with the table and filtering some information allowed me to be able to create the first line graph.

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- The second analysis I performed was the outcomes based on goals. Here we created a new sheet in excel and manually created a new table. In the table, we created a title with the number of plays that were successful, failed, and cancelled. Also titles with the total number of projects, the percentage of successful plays, as well as those that failed and cancelled. We used these titles in order to analyse each play and their fundraising goals. 

- I ran some 'CountIfs' formulas to pull data from our kickstarter challenge data sheet and that led us to finding out exactly how the plays performed based on their goals. I ran a simple 'Sum' formula and some other formulas to find the percentages mentioned above. Once finished, I created a line graph to allow me to view the data in a quick and simple manner. After some formatting, I was able to finish the graph and come to a conclusion on their performances.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- One conclusion I can quickly see from our data and graph is that the most successful plays were in months of April to August, with May and June being the best 2-month period.

- Another conclusion I came up with was that the winter months of December and January had the least number of successful launch dates as well as an average number of failed plays. It is also important to mention that January was the month with the most cancelled launches with 7.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- My conclusion on the outcomes based on goals section is that a fundraising goal less than or equal to $5,000 had the best opportunity for success. This conclusion comes as the data shows 73.5% (529) of 720 plays were successful. A steep goal of $50,000 or more was destined for failure as 14 of 16 plays failed, with only 2 being successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- I don't think there were many limitations on the data set, however one issue that took me a while to fix was the date format. When we started the excel, I used the formula to change the "deadline" and "launched at '' dated from numbers to actual dates. However, I forgot to change the excel to actually use the formula and make the dates readable so I had to look up how to do it, etc. I made things way more complicated on myself than they had to be. I think the limitation was that the data simply didn't have the dates in a human-readable format and me as the user had to manually fix that.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Another type of graphic we could use is a scatter plot. If we mess around with the data enough, we can see if there is a correlation between the month the play is expected to launch and if it is successful. We could also use a pie chart to quickly see all of the plays as a whole and colour code the different sections to see what percentage of the plays were successful, cancelled, or failed.
